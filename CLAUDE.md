# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an HTMX tutorial repository written in Japanese, consisting of comprehensive documentation across 10 chapters. The repository contains only Markdown files with tutorial content - no actual code implementations yet.

## Repository Structure

The tutorial is organized into 10 progressive chapters:
- Chapter 1: Basic concepts and philosophy of HTMX
- Chapter 2: Environment setup and installation
- Chapter 3: Basic HTTP attributes (hx-get, hx-post)
- Chapter 4: Response control (hx-target, hx-swap)
- Chapter 5: Event handling and triggers (hx-trigger)
- Chapter 6: Form processing and validation
- Chapter 7: Loading indicators and error handling
- Chapter 8: Building a complete TODO application
- Chapter 9: Data persistence methods (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, caching)
- Chapter 10: Database integration (SQL and NoSQL databases)

## Common Tasks

Since this is currently a documentation-only repository, the main tasks involve:
- Adding code examples to accompany the tutorial content
- Creating sample applications for each chapter
- Setting up a demo server for the examples

When implementing code examples, use the following structure:
- Place HTML examples in each chapter directory
- Use Python Flask or Node.js Express for server-side examples (as referenced in the tutorial)
- Keep examples self-contained within each chapter when possible

## Important Context

The tutorial is designed for beginners and includes:
- Detailed explanations in Japanese
- Practice problems at the end of each chapter
- Progressive difficulty from basic concepts to a full application
- Focus on server-side rendering with minimal JavaScript

Chapter 8 contains a complete TODO application example with:
- Frontend HTML/CSS/JavaScript code
- Backend implementation in Flask (Python)
- Progressive Web App features
- Drag-and-drop functionality

The later chapters (9-10) cover advanced topics:
- Chapter 9: Client-side data persistence techniques
- Chapter 10: Server-side database integration with real-world examples
